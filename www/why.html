						<div class="content-box">
							<p class="p-large">Entrepreneurship is a challenging endeavor that involves understanding and leveraging the intricacies of human nature to succeed. Through our work in business, we express every aspect of ourselves, from our deepest passions and desires to the issues and frustrations we have struggled with throughout our lives. </p>

							<p>As such, it is crucial to recognize that all business transactions become inherently personal, requiring a nuanced understanding of the multi-dimensional nature of the people conducting them. Our organizations reflect our beliefs, attitudes, limitations, and biases, and to succeed, we must confront any unresolved issues or frustrations that may be holding us back. This requires a willingness to engage in self-reflection and to understand the underlying psychological and emotional factors that drive our decisions and actions.</p>

							<p>By doing so, we can develop a strategic approach to entrepreneurship that is grounded in our personal values and sense of purpose. Ultimately, entrepreneurship is a journey of self-discovery, where success is not only measured by financial gain but also by the realization of our fullest potential.</p>

							<h6>The awareness of the game</h6>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
						<div class="content-box">
							<p>When entrepreneurs become aware of how their own biases, attitudes, and limitations are reflected in their businesses, and how profoundly their organizations reflect their own personal values and beliefs, they often begin to view the process of entrepreneurship as a game of learning and personal and professional growth, where the object becomes successful navigation of their own psychology and translation of that learning into meaningful plans and action that achieve a meaningful and lasting success.
							
							<p>Through this lens, many of the challenges encountered in starting, growing, and sustaining a business become puzzles to be solved instead of obstacles to be overcome, with success being the ultimate prize but almost never the only one. By fully realizing themselves, entrepreneurs can not only achieve their business goals but also fulfill their deepest desires and passions, making the journey all the more rewarding.</p>

							<h6>A spiritual foundation</h6>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="col-12 col-lg-8">
						<div class="content-box">

							<p>As spirits born into physical form, we each have a unique path to fulfill in our lifetime. Self-discovery and personal growth are essential to realizing our potential and fulfilling that purpose.</p>

							<p>Starting, growing, and maintaining a business can be deeply aided by this awareness, tapping into our own spiritual guidance to understand ever more deeply the psychological, emotional, and spiritual aspects of ourselves, and through this awareness create breakthroughs in business planning and decision-making and ultimately influence success.</p>

							<p>In order to achieve optimal outcomes, business leaders must first become aware of and then invest in their own personal and professional development. First, by embracing a growth mindset, and on that foundation incorporating awarness of our spiritual nature and the potential for guidance from our spiritual selves. Then, by using that guidance to enhance their own performance while also inspiring their teams and organizations to reach their full potential. This requires a willingness to take calculated risks, embrace uncertainty and ambiguity, and learn from both successes and failures, all while remaining grounded in a sense of purpose and mission and awareness of ourselves as spiritual beings.</p>

							<p>It's easy to forget that at the heart of every company lies the deeply personal nature of the work being done. Business is not just a job, but a reflection of the people behind it and their awareness of themselves. For entrepreneurs, this means that every aspect of themselves is expressed through their companies, whether they intend it to be reflected or not.</p>

							<p>Understanding this personal, spiritual, and essential nature of ourselves is critical to business success. Only by embracing our authentic selves can we create companies that align with our values and sense of purpose. This is not just a matter of ethics, but of strategy as well. Companies that fail to understand or delivery this authenticity, and the exectuives that create and run them, risk being left behind in today's incredibly fast moving, highly personality-driven, digital-first landscape.</p>

							<p class="p-bold">As a seasoned practitioner in the field of technology, I have borne witness to the sweeping impact of AI in the workplace.</p>

							<p>AI is the most disruptive technology wave that has ever been invented, and holds the potential to radically change the landscape of business, employment and entrepreneurship.</p>

							<p>Stewardship and maturity in the application of these technologies becomes critical in making sure that these technologies are used for good. Now, we, as a special, confront for the first time a corporeal intelligence which is greater than our own, and has the very real capacity to destroy everything, but in that same moment of power the ability to heal in equal part. </p>

							<p>Does not then the awareness of our own morality, inner light, and intentions become even more profoundly powerful, especially as we mentor for the first time what is almost another species of intelligence that is our own creation.</p>
														
							<p>Looking ahead, the rapid advancement of artificial intelligence is poised to accelerate the pace of digital transformation, presenting significant challenges for companies seeking to remain relevant. As a business catalyst, I collaborate with companies of all sizes to develop tailored digital-first strategies that address their unique needs and objectives. By fostering a culture of innovation and experimentation, I aim to help companies address and thrive in the dawning of the age of AI.</p>
							
							<h4>Entrepreneurship</h4>
							
							<p>The unprecedented pace of digital transformation, driven by AI, affords us a salient opportunity to embark upon the entrepreneurship journey. By leveraging AI, entrepreneurs can streamline routine tasks, scrutinize massive data sets, and fashion innovative products and services. By adopting AI, entrepreneurs can construct ventures that are not only more efficient and productive, but also more successful than their erstwhile counterparts.</p>
							
							<h4>Innovation</h4>
							<p>AI represents a powerful impetus for innovation. By automating rote tasks and facilitating swift, precise decision-making, AI liberates time and resources for entrepreneurs and enterprises alike to focus on creativity and experimentation. With AI, entrepreneurs can venture into hitherto-unexplored markets, conceive pioneering products, and devise novel solutions to intricate problems.</p>

							<h4>Strategy</h4>
							<p>As AI continues to upend traditional workflows, it is incumbent upon businesses to engineer AI strategies that cater to their idiosyncratic requirements and aspirations. AI enables businesses to optimize operations, reduce costs, and heighten customer experiences. However, executing an effective AI strategy necessitates a profound comprehension of the technology, the business, and the market. As a business catalyst, I collaborate with companies of all scopes to craft AI strategies that engender growth and prosperity.</p>

							<h4>The Future of Work: Embracing AI as a Partner</h4>

							<p>As we gaze towards the future, I am ardently enthusiastic about exploring the manifold prospects presented by AI and the way it can help us shape a more innovative, more optimal world of work. To reap the full dividends of AI, we must approach it as a partner rather than a substitute for human labor. By joining forces with AI, we can attain unparalleled levels of productivity and innovation that hitherto seemed elusive.</p>

							<p>Moreover, the proliferation of AI has impelled us to contemplate our relationship with ourselves as sentient beings. In a world where machines are becoming increasingly adept at intricate tasks, it is all the more imperative for us to nurture our unique human attributes, such as creativity, empathy, and critical thinking. By doing so, we can guarantee our relevance and worth in a rapidly transforming world.</p>

							<p>As a business catalyst, I am committed to inspiring entrepreneurs, innovators, and strategists to unite with me in crafting a future of work that is both financially lucrative and socially responsible, that fosters personal fulfillment and benefits everyone. In concert, we can shape the future of work in a manner that is both technologically advanced and rooted in humanity.</p>
								
							<p>Through my work, I hope to inspire others to join me in building a future of work that is not only financially rewarding, but also socially responsible, personally fulfilling, aligned with our spiritual natures, and beneficial for all.</p>

							<p class="p-bold">Companies are a vision that everyone supports and agrees to create. As much as we enshrine founders, it is clients and customers who breath life into ventures with their faith in founders, products and services, and an ecosystem that enables companies to thrive.</p>
							
							<p>Founders simply find a fit between what people want and a way to create and deliver it for them — the customers and the feedback from those you serve tell you what is true.</p>

							<p>The mentality for too long as been one of trying to strip mine as much value as possible to drive short-term results, regardless of the cost. This "return on capital" focus has created a workforce where over a third of founders burn out, most employees are disengaged, and faith in the system is collapsing at record levels.</p>

							<h4>We can barely manage what we measure.</h4>

							<p>Peter Drucker never said, "What gets measured gets managed." He didn't say it, and all of those Harvard articles and books that use the phrase are simply not true. Think about that. That entire management ethos, in fact the entire line of business culture that has driven corporations for decades, is based on something the man never even said. And that's revealing.</p>
							
							<p>Besides, what it should say is, “What gets measured gets managed — even when it’s pointless to measure and manage it, and even if it harms the purpose and people in the organisation to do so." The dysfunctional concequences of poor management and improper performance metrics and the culture that supports them are taking us away to workplace authenticity and towards totalitarian cultures of work that no longer serve the majority of us.</p>
							
							<p>Not everything that matters can be measured. Not everything that we can measure matters.</p>
								
							<p></p>What can be measured can be managed. But what is Success can no longer be measured simply in returns to capital. It is simply limited thinking and it's not enough anymore.</p>
							
							<p>We must look for new metrics to draw from, that are more wholistic, serve a larger purpose, and incorporate people, our balance with nature and sustainability into their core.</p>

							<p>Intentionality and what the company stands for matters more than ever.</p>

							<p>A well run company does not compete, because it has defined itself so clearly that no compeititon matters. This is the essence of building a brand. This is why exceptional returns on VC investment are generated by just a few founders — those founders are not playing by the same rules of competition that everyone else is. They don't compete with others. They are running their own race.</p>

This is why exceptional returns on VC investment are generated by just a few founders — those founders are not playing by the same rules of competition that everyone else is. They don't compete.</p>

							<h4>Intentionality</h4>

							<p>Intentionality and bigness, collaborative. You’re power is in the present. You can’t know the future, and even if you could, it offers no protection to do so. Being completely present, and following our inner guidance, is all the protection anyone ever needs.</p>

									<p class="p-bold">While profits are undoubtedly a critical metric for any business, they do not necessarily capture the full picture of a company's success or impact. There are several other metrics that can also be important in measuring a company's overall performance and effectiveness.</p>
		
									<p>One such metric is social impact. This measures the positive effect a business has on society, such as reducing poverty, improving access to education and healthcare, or promoting environmental sustainability. Businesses that prioritize social impact as a key performance indicator may measure their success through a variety of indicators, such as the number of people reached by their initiatives, the amount of carbon emissions reduced, or the percentage of profits donated to charitable causes.</p>

									<p></p>Another important metric is employee satisfaction. Companies that prioritize employee satisfaction are likely to have a more engaged and productive workforce, which can in turn contribute to better business outcomes. Employee satisfaction can be measured through a variety of means, such as employee surveys, retention rates, and reviews on job sites.</p>
										
										Other important metrics may include customer satisfaction, innovation, and brand reputation. Ultimately, the specific metrics that matter most will depend on the nature and goals of the business in question. However, by looking beyond mere profits, businesses can gain a more holistic understanding of their impact and effectiveness.
